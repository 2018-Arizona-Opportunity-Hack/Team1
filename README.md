Run npm install in both the node-server and front-end folders

__FRONT-END__
- First, navigate to the front-end folder and type in `npm run watch` to get webpack to build the bundle.js file
- Next, (for now) copy the path to the index.html file in the front-end folder and paste it into your browser
- If you want to see any changes manifest, make sure the change was valid and webpack still built, then refresh the page that you have pasted the index.html path to
